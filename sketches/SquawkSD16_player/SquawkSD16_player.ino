/**
SquawkSD16 using Fat16 library

Fat16 is a bit limited comparing to standard SD, but much slimer.
Website for Fat16 https://code.google.com/p/fat16lib/

When running on Leonardo, comparing to SquawkSD_player, this one goes 
from 21,506 to 16,000 byte. 5k bytes saved!

Note: pin mapping for SD card is defined in SdCard.cpp of Fat16 library.
If you're using a unconventional board, or if the example is not working
when it should, fix the mappings in that file!

/*
Since Timer0 is used for Arduino functionality, such as delay() it is not
recommended to use a pin that relies on this timer for output, as Squawk
needs to reconfigure the timer for higher-speed, which modifies how these
Arduino internals behave. Uncomment the correct line below, depending on
which Arduino you intend to run the code on.

Note: You CAN use any pin, if you do not rely on Timer0 related things.

Leonardo
  use SQUAWK_PWM_PIN5 (it's on Timer3)
  
Uno, Due(milanove), Diecimila, Nano, Mini or LilyPad
  only use SQUAWK_PWM_PIN3 (it's on Timer2)
  because SQUAWK_PWM_PIN11 is used for SD card access
  
Others
  not yet supported, you'll have to try and see what happens ;)
